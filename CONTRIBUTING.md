## How to contribute to `pip-review`

First rule: please **do** contribute!

I (@jgonggrijp) want to keep `pip-review` in the air, but I can't dedicate much time to maintaining it. So if you see a way to improve `pip-review`, whether it's fixing a bug or adding a feature, please go ahead and do it. I will happily accept your pull request.

### Wish list

 - Python 3 compatibility

### The fine print

This repo ([jgonggrijp/pip-review](https://github.com/jgonggrijp/pip-review)) uses [gitflow](https://github.com/nvie/gitflow). Please submit pull requests to the `develop` branch.

The Python files (currently only `pip_review.py`) use 4-space soft tabs. The other files use 2-space soft tabs.
