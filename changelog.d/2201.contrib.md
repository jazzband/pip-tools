The [change log entry bot] has been explicitly configured to stop requiring
news fragments in pull requests having the [`skip-changelog` label] set
-- by {user}`sirosen` and {user}`webknjaz`.

It was also set up to reference our change log authoring document from the
GitHub Checks pages. And the reported check name is now set to `Change log entry`.
