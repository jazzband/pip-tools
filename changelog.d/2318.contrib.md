`pip-tools` now has a policy regarding LLM-generated contributions, noted in the
contributing documentation -- by {user}`sirosen`.

Thanks to {user}`0cjs`, {user}`gpshead`, {user}`mr-c`, {user}`samdoran`,
{user}`webknjaz`, and everyone else in the broader community who helped us
to craft a policy which is considerate of contributors and protective of the
project and its maintainers.
