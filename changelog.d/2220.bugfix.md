Fixed a bug in which `pip-compile` lost any index URL options when looking up hashes -- by {user}`sirosen`.

This caused errors when a package was only available from an extra index, and caused `pip-compile` to incorrectly drop index URL options from output, even when they were present in the input requirements.
