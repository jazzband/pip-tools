- Fixed duplicated --trusted-host, --extra-index-url and --index-url in the generated
  requirements.

## 1.8.2 (2017-03-28)

- Regression fix: editable reqs were loosing their dependencies after first round
  ([#476](https://github.com/jazzband/pip-tools/pull/476)) Thanks @mattlong
- Remove duplicate index urls in generated requirements.txt
  ([#468](https://github.com/jazzband/pip-tools/pull/468)) Thanks @majuscule

## 1.8.1 (2017-03-22)

- Recalculate secondary dependencies between rounds (#378)
- Calculated dependencies could be left with wrong candidates when toplevel requirements
  happen to be also pinned in sub-dependencies (#450)
- Fix duplicate entries that could happen in generated requirements.txt (#427)
- Gracefully report invalid pip version (#457)
- Fix capitalization in the generated requirements.txt, packages will always be
  lowercased (#452)

## 1.8.0 (2016-11-17)

- Adds support for upgrading individual packages with a new option `--upgrade-package`.
  To upgrade a _specific_ package to the latest or a specific version use
  `--upgrade-package <pkg>`. To upgrade all packages, you can still use
  `pip-compile --upgrade`. (#409)
- Adds support for pinning dependencies even further by including the hashes found on
  PyPI at compilation time, which will be re-checked when dependencies are installed at
  installation time. This adds protection against packages that are tampered with.
  (#383)
- Improve support for extras, like `hypothesis[django]`
- Drop support for pip < 8

## 1.7.1 (2016-10-20)

- Add `--allow-unsafe` option (#377)

## 1.7.0 (2016-07-06)

- Add compatibility with pip >= 8.1.2 (#374) Thanks so much, @jmbowman!

## 1.6.5 (2016-05-11)

- Add warning that pip >= 8.1.2 is not supported until 1.7.x is out

## 1.6.4 (2016-05-03)

- Incorporate fix for atomic file saving behaviour on the Windows platform (see #351)

## 1.6.3 (2016-05-02)

- PyPI won't let me upload 1.6.2

## 1.6.2 (2016-05-02)

- Respect pip configuration from pip.{ini,conf}
- Fixes for atomic-saving of output files on Windows (see #351)

## 1.6.1 (2016-04-06)

Minor changes:

- pip-sync now supports being invoked from within and outside an activated virtualenv
  (see #317)
- pip-compile: support -U as a shorthand for --upgrade
- pip-compile: support pip's --no-binary and --binary-only flags

Fixes:

- Change header format of output files to mention all input files

## 1.6 (2016-02-05)

Major change:

- pip-compile will by default try to fulfill package specs by looking at a previously
  compiled output file first, before checking PyPI. This means pip-compile will only
  update the requirements.txt when it absolutely has to. To get the old behaviour
  (picking the latest version of all packages from PyPI), use the new `--upgrade`
  option.

Minor changes:

- Bugfix where pip-compile would lose "via" info when on pip 8 (see #313)
- Ensure cache dir exists (see #315)

## 1.5 (2016-01-23)

- Add support for pip >= 8
- Drop support for pip < 7
- Fix bug where `pip-sync` fails to uninstall packages if you're using the `--no-index`
  (or other) flags

## 1.4.5 (2016-01-20)

- Add `--no-index` flag to `pip-compile` to avoid emitting `--index-url` into the output
  (useful if you have configured a different index in your global ~/.pip/pip.conf, for
  example)
- Fix: ignore stdlib backport packages, like `argparse`, when listing which packages
  will be installed/uninstalled (#286)
- Fix pip-sync failed uninstalling packages when using `--find-links` (#298)
- Explicitly error when pip-tools is used with pip 8.0+ (for now)

## 1.4.4 (2016-01-11)

- Fix: unintended change in behaviour where packages installed by `pip-sync` could
  accidentally get upgraded under certain conditions, even though the requirements.txt
  would dictate otherwise (see #290)

## 1.4.3 (2016-01-06)

- Fix: add `--index-url` and `--extra-index-url` options to `pip-sync`
- Fix: always install using `--upgrade` flag when running `pip-sync`

## 1.4.2 (2015-12-13)

- Fix bug where umask was ignored when writing requirement files (#268)

## 1.4.1 (2015-12-13)

- Fix bug where successive invocations of pip-sync with editables kept
  uninstalling/installing them (fixes #270)

## 1.4.0 (2015-12-13)

- Add command line option -f / --find-links
- Add command line option --no-index
- Add command line alias -n (for --dry-run)
- Fix a unicode issue

## 1.3.0 (2015-12-08)

- Support multiple requirement files to pip-compile
- Support requirements from stdin for pip-compile
- Support --output-file option on pip-compile, to redirect output to a file (or stdout)

## 1.2.0 (2015-11-30)

- Add CHANGELOG :)
- Support pip-sync'ing editable requirements
- Support extras properly (i.e. package[foo] syntax)

(Anything before 1.2.0 was not recorded.)
