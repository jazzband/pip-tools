# 1.8.2 (2017-03-28)

- Regression fix: editable reqs were loosing their dependencies after first round ([#476](https://github.com/jazzband/pip-tools/pull/476))
  Thanks @mattlong
- Remove duplicate index urls in generated requirements.txt ([#468](https://github.com/jazzband/pip-tools/pull/468))
  Thanks @majuscule

# 1.8.1 (2017-03-22)

- Recalculate secondary dependencies between rounds (#378)
- Calculated dependencies could be left with wrong candidates when
  toplevel requirements happen to be also pinned in sub-dependencies (#450)
- Fix duplicate entries that could happen in generated requirements.txt (#427)
- Gracefully report invalid pip version (#457)
- Fix capitalization in the generated requirements.txt, packages will always be lowercased (#452)

# 1.8.0 (2016-11-17)

- Adds support for upgrading individual packages with a new option
  `--upgrade-package`.  To upgrade a _specific_ package to the latest or
  a specific version use `--upgrade-package <pkg>`.  To upgrade all packages,
  you can still use `pip-compile --upgrade`.  (#409)
- Adds support for pinning dependencies even further by including the hashes
  found on PyPI at compilation time, which will be re-checked when dependencies
  are installed at installation time.  This adds protection against packages
  that are tampered with.  (#383)
- Improve support for extras, like `hypothesis[django]`
- Drop support for pip < 8


# 1.7.1 (2016-10-20)

- Add `--allow-unsafe` option (#377)


# 1.7.0 (2016-07-06)

- Add compatibility with pip >= 8.1.2 (#374)
  Thanks so much, @jmbowman!


# 1.6.5 (2016-05-11)

- Add warning that pip >= 8.1.2 is not supported until 1.7.x is out


# 1.6.4 (2016-05-03)

- Incorporate fix for atomic file saving behaviour on the Windows platform
  (see #351)


# 1.6.3 (2016-05-02)

- PyPI won't let me upload 1.6.2


# 1.6.2 (2016-05-02)

- Respect pip configuration from pip.{ini,conf}
- Fixes for atomic-saving of output files on Windows (see #351)


# 1.6.1 (2016-04-06)

Minor changes:
- pip-sync now supports being invoked from within and outside an activated
  virtualenv (see #317)
- pip-compile: support -U as a shorthand for --upgrade
- pip-compile: support pip's --no-binary and --binary-only flags

Fixes:
- Change header format of output files to mention all input files


# 1.6 (2016-02-05)

Major change:
- pip-compile will by default try to fulfill package specs by looking at
  a previously compiled output file first, before checking PyPI.  This means
  pip-compile will only update the requirements.txt when it absolutely has to.
  To get the old behaviour (picking the latest version of all packages from
  PyPI), use the new `--upgrade` option.

Minor changes:
- Bugfix where pip-compile would lose "via" info when on pip 8 (see #313)
- Ensure cache dir exists (see #315)


# 1.5 (2016-01-23)

- Add support for pip >= 8
- Drop support for pip < 7

  `--no-index` (or other) flags


# 1.4.5 (2016-01-20)

- Add `--no-index` flag to `pip-compile` to avoid emitting `--index-url` into
  the output (useful if you have configured a different index in your global
  ~/.pip/pip.conf, for example)
- Fix: ignore stdlib backport packages, like `argparse`, when listing which
  packages will be installed/uninstalled (#286)
- Fix pip-sync failed uninstalling packages when using `--find-links` (#298)
- Explicitly error when pip-tools is used with pip 8.0+ (for now)


# 1.4.4 (2016-01-11)

- Fix: unintended change in behaviour where packages installed by `pip-sync`
  could accidentally get upgraded under certain conditions, even though the
  requirements.txt would dictate otherwise (see #290)


# 1.4.3 (2016-01-06)

- Fix: add `--index-url` and `--extra-index-url` options to `pip-sync`
- Fix: always install using `--upgrade` flag when running `pip-sync`


# 1.4.2 (2015-12-13)

- Fix bug where umask was ignored when writing requirement files (#268)


# 1.4.1 (2015-12-13)

- Fix bug where successive invocations of pip-sync with editables kept
  uninstalling/installing them (fixes #270)


# 1.4.0 (2015-12-13)

- Add command line option -f / --find-links
- Add command line option --no-index
- Add command line alias -n (for --dry-run)
- Fix a unicode issue


# 1.3.0 (2015-12-08)

- Support multiple requirement files to pip-compile
- Support requirements from stdin for pip-compile
- Support --output-file option on pip-compile, to redirect output to a file (or stdout)

- Add CHANGELOG :)
- Support pip-sync'ing editable requirements
- Support extras properly (i.e. package[foo] syntax)

(Anything before 1.2.0 was not recorded.)
