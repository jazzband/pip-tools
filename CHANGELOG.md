# 1.6.1

- pip-sync now support being invoked from within and outside an activated
  virtualenv (see 317)


# 1.6

Major change:
- pip-compile will by default try to fulfill package specs by looking at
  a previously compiled output file first, before checking PyPI.  This means
  pip-compile will only update the requirements.txt when it absolutely has to.
  To get the old behaviour (picking the latest version of all packages from
  PyPI), use the new `--upgrade` option.

Minor changes:
- Bugfix where pip-compile would lose "via" info when on pip 8 (see #313)
- Ensure cache dir exists (see #315)


# 1.5

- Add support for pip>=8
- Drop support for pip<7
- Fix bug where `pip-sync` fails to uninstall packages if you're using the
  `--no-index` (or other) flags


# 1.4.5

- Add `--no-index` flag to `pip-compile` to avoid emitting `--index-url` into
  the output (useful if you have configured a different index in your global
  ~/.pip/pip.conf, for example)
- Fix: ignore stdlib backport packages, like `argparse`, when listing which
  packages will be installed/uninstalled (#286)
- Fix pip-sync failed uninstalling packages when using `--find-links` (#298)
- Explicitly error when pip-tools is used with pip 8.0+ (for now)


# 1.4.4

- Fix: unintended change in behaviour where packages installed by `pip-sync`
  could accidentally get upgraded under certain conditions, even though the
  requirements.txt would dictate otherwise (see #290)


# 1.4.3

- Fix: add `--index-url` and `--extra-index-url` options to `pip-sync`
- Fix: always install using `--upgrade` flag when running `pip-sync`


# 1.4.2

- Fix bug where umask was ignored when writing requirement files (#268)


# 1.4.1

- Fix bug where successive invocations of pip-sync with editables kept
  uninstalling/installing them (fixes #270)


# 1.4.0

- Add command line option -f / --find-links
- Add command line option --no-index
- Add command line alias -n (for --dry-run)
- Fix a unicode issue


# 1.3.0

- Support multiple requirement files to pip-compile
- Support requirements from stdin for pip-compile
- Support --output-file option on pip-compile, to redirect output to a file (or stdout)


# 1.2.0

- Add CHANGELOG :)
- Support pip-sync'ing editable requirements
- Support extras properly (i.e. package[foo] syntax)

(Anything before 1.2.0 was not recorded.)
