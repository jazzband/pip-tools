Create a new playground first:

  $ virtualenv --python="$(which python)" FOO >/dev/null
  $ PATH=FOO/bin:$PATH
  $ pip install 'pip<1.5' > /dev/null 2>&1
  $ pip install argparse >/dev/null 2>&1
  $ export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:$TESTDIR/..
  $ function pip_compile() {
  >   export PIPTOOLS_ROOT="${TESTDIR}/.pip-tools"
  >   rm -fr "$PIPTOOLS_ROOT"
  >   "$TESTDIR/../bin/pip-compile" $@
  > }
  $ alias pip-compile=pip_compile

Let's create a couple of simple requirements.in files:

  $ echo "nose" > dev-requirements.in
  $ echo "raven==1.9.3" > requirements.in

Compile with --dry-run:

  $ pip-compile --dry-run --verbose
  ===> Collecting source requirements
  nose (from dev-requirements.in:1)
  raven==1.9.3 (from requirements.in:1)
  
  ===> Normalizing source requirements
  nose (from dev-requirements.in:1)
  raven==1.9.3 (from requirements.in:1)
  
  ===> Resolving full tree
  - Finding best package matching ['nose']
    Found best match: 1.2.1 (from PyPI)
  - Getting dependencies for nose-1.2.1
    Found: [] (from dependency cache)

  Dry-run, so nothing updated.

Let's create a simple requirements.in file:

  $ rm dev-requirements.in
  $ echo "raven==1.9.3" > requirements.in
  $ echo "simplejson==2.3.3" >> requirements.in
