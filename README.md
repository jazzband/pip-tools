pip-tools = pip-compile + pip-sync
==================================

A set of command line tools to help you keep your `pip`-based packages fresh,
even when you've pinned them.  [You do pin them, right?][0]

Installation
============

```console
$ pip install --upgrade pip  # pip-tools needs pip==6.1 or higher (!)
$ pip install pip-tools
```


Example usage for `pip-compile`
===============================

Suppose you have a Flask project, and want to pin it for production.  Write the
following line to a file:

    # requirements.in
    Flask

Now, run `pip-compile requirements.in`:

```console
$ pip-compile requirements.in
#
# This file is autogenerated by pip-compile
# Make changes in requirements.in, then run this to update:
#
#    pip-compile requirements.in
#
flask==0.10.1
itsdangerous==0.24        # via flask
jinja2==2.7.3             # via flask
markupsafe==0.23          # via jinja2
werkzeug==0.10.4          # via flask
```

And it will produce your `requirements.txt`, with all the Flask dependencies
(and all underlying dependencies) pinned.  Put this file under version control
as well and periodically re-run `pip-compile` to update the packages.


Example usage for `pip-sync`
============================

Now that you have a `requirements.txt`, you can use `pip-sync` to update your
virtual env to reflect exactly what's in there.  Note: this will
install/upgrade/uninstall everything necessary to match the `requirements.txt`
contents.

```console
$ pip-sync
